Description:

ASPROW is an open source project started by 'Orhun Alp Oral' in 2009 November.

The aim of this project is preparing the record/grid views of the tables which are available in database.

By using ASPROW people can easily prepare web based solutions for their company or organization.

ASPROW generates only one page (by writing few lines) for individual view other files are just includes to that page, therefore it is the easiest way to generate online database applications.

In addition to simple generation of pages there is also a wizard that provides to select details without writing any code in few minutes.

Requirements:

1. IIS Server. 2. MS Access or MS SQL Server (mySQL is not fully supported!) to access the database. 3. Read/Write permissions to application root.
